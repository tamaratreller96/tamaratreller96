⚡ Tamara Treller — Software Developer | Backend Engineer | Systems Architect
I build secure, modular, audit‑ready systems with a focus on fintech, simulation, and real‑world business logic. My work blends Python, Flask, PHP, SQL, and advanced OOP to create backend architectures that are transparent, scalable, and production‑grade.

🧩 Backend-first mindset: I design systems that prioritize data integrity, constraints, and traceability.

🛠️ Hands-on problem solver: I move fast, debug deeply, and architect clean, maintainable modules.

🗄️ SQL specialist: Schema design, referential integrity, constraints, triggers, and realistic datasets.

🔐 Security-aware: Currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

🧠 Systems thinker: I care about concurrency, replication, logging, and real-world auditability.

🎯 Mission-driven: I build software that empowers users and makes complex systems understandable.

Currently completing my Software Development Diploma at ABM College (Feb 2026) and actively building portfolio projects that reflect real production environments — not toy examples.

If you're looking for a developer who treats every project like it’s going live tomorrow, let’s talk.
